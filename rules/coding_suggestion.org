* Coding suggestion
** Be concise
   Remove useless brank spaces, lines, comments, header files.
   Try to reconstruct the code to be more efficient, fast and easy-understanding.
   Put the common and the unchange part outside.
   Use the suitable space to make the code more readable.
   Try to align the "=" when several assignments.

** Pi
   Used M_PI.
   Don't using "#define" to define the conversion between rad and degree.
   In pcl, there is DEG2RAD and RAD2DEG
** Headers include
   Be structure, from system, publish libraries to self-defined header files.
   Seperate with blank line.
   Remove useless header files.
** namespace
   Group the code using namespace.
** Brackets
   Use the style in the funtion definitions.
   #+BEGIN_QUOTE
   void someFunction(void)
   {
   }
   #+END_QUOTE

** #define
Avoid to use macro, try to use the const.
** Use TODO FIXME NOTE to remind you the code statue
**
